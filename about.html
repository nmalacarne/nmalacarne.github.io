    Hello, my name is Nicholas Malacarne, and I am a developer. My work is primarily
    web based, and I love learning and using both front-end and back-end technologies.
    I am currently employed at <a href="http://craterdust.com" target="_blank">CraterDust, LLC</a>,
    and I am loving every minute of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from <a href="http://www.gwinnetttech.edu/" target="_blank">Gwinnett Tech</a> with an
    Associate of Applied Science Degree - Computer Programming. The curriculum comprised mainly of
    Jave/JavaEE, but I was also subjected to other languages such as PHP, Python, JavaScript, and C++.
    I fell in love with web development at first sight, and I was especially intrigued by technologies
    that dealt with the communication between client and server such as AJAX.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the day I graduated, I have worked in a few professional development environments. My first
    job was maintaining a legacy PHP web application. I worked mainly with back-end technologies during this time.
    I learned a lot about PHP, MySQL, and how to work on and maintain a large code base. Towards the end of my stay,
    the team started dabbling in AngularJS, and was in the process of moving from SVN to Git.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was later offered a position at <a href="http://craterdust.com" target="_blank">CraterDust, LLC</a>
    which was extremely exciting. I work with a group of talented designers which means that I get to focus not only
    on back-end technologies, but also a lot of client-side as well. Since I have been here, we have designed and
    developed Facebook applications, splash pages, and ECommerce migrations and setups. I look forward to growing
    digitally.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my spare time, I like to learn new languages, libraries, and technologies. I also enjoy writing scripts
    for the computer games that I play. My social life is comprised of hanging out with my super awesome partner,
    talking nerdy with my father, and the occasional table-top gaming session.
  </p>

  <p>
    I built this site so that I could document the many programming adventures which
    I undertake, and I would also like to write about what I learn along the way.
