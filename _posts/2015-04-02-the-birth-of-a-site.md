title: The Birth of a Site.

Huzzah! This is the first post to my new site. I just got [a new book](http://www.poodr.com/)
in the mail today, and I can not wait to dive in. I plan on starting a small project
while I read through the book, and I will post my progress as I go. I am thinking
something along the lines of a text game written in Ruby (duh!).
